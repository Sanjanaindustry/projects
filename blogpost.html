          <p class="font">In the realm of science fiction, there are plenty of stories focused on technology that ends up having a sinister effect on humankind. And as technology continues to play a greater role in our work and personal lives, cautionary tales have arisen that remind us that even tools created with the best intentions can cause unexpected problems.
 However, there’s no doubt technology has also added significant improvements in the lives of people around the globe, including recent, rapidly deployed health, workplace and commerce technologies. Below, experts from Forbes Technology Council share their selections for technologies that have had a truly positive impact on the greater good.
          1. Home Fitness Tech  The pandemic has caused an entire cottage industry to spring up around the concept of the home gym. Many startups have launched innovative new products in the digital gym arena that focus on ease of use and space-saving design. Artificial intelligence has added features to these products that bring all the benefits of a personal trainer without having to step out of your home. - Greg Bhatia, ShoreWise Consulting
           PROMOTEDAI-Powered Healthcare Artificial intelligence applied to healthcare has already been a game-changer. AI can be applied throughout the entire patient journey, including monitoring individual health through the use of wearable devices, using devices that provide alerts for specific events and supporting doctors and patients with virtual assistants. The benefits will be even more evident as this technology advances. - Antonio Giarrusso, Userbot
       4. Mental Health AppsMental health and resilience are critical elements of success and have a major impact on all aspects of our life. Meditation and wellness apps have become a lifeline in the age of remote work and hyperproductivity. They’re not only making an impact on people's performance at work but also on their health and happiness at home. - Joanna Riley, Censia Talent Intelligence
 5. Tech That Promotes Inclusivity Using augmented intelligence for inclusion purposes—such as voice-assisted devices to help people with certain disabilities and improve quality of life—can be positively transformational if made widely accessible. Harvesting open-source data and intelligence to model the environmental impact (that is, hidden costs) of the digital age is another emerging application of technology that could lead to significant global benefits. - Simone Steel, Nationwide Building Society
 6. Online Learning PlatformsOnline learning platforms will have a tremendous effect on global society. Massive open online course companies not only make world-class education attainable for people in developed nations; even more impacted are the citizens of developing nations, who have limited access to leading academic institutions. The democratization of education could lead to rapid progress in global innovation and advance humanity as a whole. - Mischa Steiner, Awesense, Inc. 7. Blockchain
        When people hear “blockchain,” they think cryptocurrency—but really, blockchain technology is about transparency. Used right, it ensures trust and accountability. With so much attention shifting to environmental, social and governance issues there’s a rising need for companies to quantify their emissions and sustainability efforts so investors can verify their data. Because of this, blockchain is going to play a pivotal role in addrn the realm of science fiction, there are plenty of stories focused on technology that ends up having a sinister effect on humankind.
